# The LaTeX Tagged PDF Project



This [tagging-project repository](https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project/) is meant to track issues and suggestions related to the "LaTeX Tagged PDF" 
project. The code for this project is split over several other repositories 
([latex2e](https://github.com/latex3/latex2e), [latex3](https://github.com/latex3/latex3), [tagpdf](https://github.com/latex3/tagpdf), ... to name a few) and so this here is a convenient place to  keep any more general topics or issues that cut across the different repositories in a single place. 

If an [issue](https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project/issues) that is recorded here requires changes in the other repositories 
sub-issues can then be opened (by us) in those repositories and linked back, 
or, if such changes are confined to a single repository, the issue could be 
transferred there – whatever is more appropriate. 

## Example documents conforming to both Well-Tagged PDF (WTPDF) and PDF/UA-2 standard produced by the LaTeX Project

Under "[Discussions](https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project/discussions)" there is a page with [WTPDF / PDF/UA-2 example documents](https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project/discussions/72) that were originally produced in March 2024 using the then current prototype code, and have been updated periodically as the code has developed. Check them out.

PDF 1.7 versions of the documents (also generated automatically by altering the `\DocumentMetadata` declaration) are now also available, see the page [PDF/UA-1 Examples by the LaTeX Project](https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project/discussions/82) for details.

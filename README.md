# The LaTeX Tagged PDF repository

See <https://www.latex-project.org/publications/indexbytopic/pdf/> for articles and other material about the "LaTeX Tagged PDF" project.

This tagging-project repository does not contain the code implementing LaTeX tagging, that is in other
repositories, notably the
[latex-lab code in the LaTeX2e repository](https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/tree/develop/required/latex-lab)
and
[tagpdf](https://github.com/latex3/tagpdf).

This repository is available for opening
[Issues](https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project/issues)
or
[Discussions](https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project/discussions).
It also hosts sources for the tagging project [GitHub pages site ](https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project) and the tagging test suite.

If an [issue](https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project/issues) that is recorded here requires changes in the other repositories 
sub-issues can then be opened (by us) in those repositories and linked back, 
or, if such changes are confined to a single repository, the issue could be 
transferred there – whatever is more appropriate.

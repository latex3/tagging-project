# Using the LaTeX prototype for accessible PDF (as of 2024/11)

The new code can be used with pdfLaTeX or the Unicode engine
luaLaTeX. The latter is the preferred engine recommended for new
documents.

The interface descriptions below are all temporary and will be replaced
with proper interfaces over time. E.g., the `\DocumentMetadata` will remain, but
the key `testphase` and its value will eventually vanish.

## Basic setup

To enable tagging in supported documents it is enough to add at the
very beginning of the document, i.e., before `\documentclass`, a
`\DocumentMetadata` declaration. It takes one argument, a key-value
list:
```latex
\DocumentMetadata{
  lang        = de,
  pdfversion  = 2.0,
  pdfstandard = ua-2,
  pdfstandard = a-4f, %or a-4
  testphase   = 
   {phase-III,
    title,
    table,
    math,
    firstaid}  
}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\section{Start}
abc
\end{document}
```
The first four keys in the example set important document metadata,
like the language, the requested PDF version and the standards the
document should comply with.

Tagging is then enabled by loading various modules through the
`testphase` key.

- The `phase-III` module activates tagging and loads support for most
  standard document elements like paragraphs, lists, sectioning, table
  of contents, graphics, floats, links and more. You should always use
  this key first.
- The `title` module redefines the `\title`, `\author`
  and `\maketitle` command to make them tagging aware. It also takes
  care that the title and author are added to the XMP metadata.

- The `table` module adds tagging support to tables like `tabular`,
  `tabularx`, `tabulary` and `longtable`. 
-  The `math` module enables basic tagging of equations.
- Finally, the `firstaid` contains small fixes of
  external packages to make them compatible with the tagging code, e.g.,
  it fixes clashes with the `cleveref` and the `booktabs`
  packages.


## Handling graphics in the document

While most tagging is done automatically by adding the
`\DocumentMetadata` command, there remain a few things the author
has to add manually. At first every graphic must be marked either as
artifact or get an alternative text describing its meaning in the
context of the document. This can be done with additional keys that
have been added to the `\includegraphics` command:

```latex
\includegraphics[height=4cm,alt={Portrait of Shakespeare}]{william-shakespeare.jpg}
\includegraphics[height=4cm,artifact]{crinklepaper}\makebox[0pt][r]{Some text }
```

## Handling tables (`tabular`) in the document

If the document contains data tables, the author has to identify the
header rows of the tables so that they can be tagged as `<TH>`
cells. By default all cells are considered data cells. This can be done
generally (in the preamble) or on a table by table basis before the table.
as shown in the following example.
```latex
\tagpdfsetup{table/header-rows={1,2}}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{Example}\\
Name&Value\\
This& 11 \\
That & 2
\end{tabular}
```


If a table should not be tagged as table, for example, because it is
merely used to ensure that the content is properly aligned, it should
be turned into a presentation table with the `table/tagging=presentation`
key as shown below.
```latex
\tagpdfsetup{table/tagging=presentation}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\textbullet & \textbullet & \textbullet \\
--- & --- & ---
\end{tabular}
```

At the moment this isn't transferred well by the derivation algorithm
from PDF to HTML, but this area will see improvements. (The PDF structure
is already correct, as one cane see in ngPDF, but the HTML/CSS
styling currently loses the grid layout.)

## Handling lists and other block structures

Most lists using standard LaTeX enviornmenst such as `enumerate` will
be tagged automatically. The new list implementation also implement an
optional _key-value_ interface with similar features to the well known
`enumitem` package, although with a different implementation.

```
\section{lists}

A list starting at 5

\begin{enumerate}[start=5] 
\item Level A1
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Level B1
  \item Level B2
  \end{enumerate}
\item Level A2
\end{enumerate}

Some text outside the list, then resume the list:

\begin{enumerate}[resume=true]
\item Level A1
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Level B1
  \item Level B2
  \end{enumerate}
\item Level A2
\end{enumerate}
```

Currently the derivation algorithm would need additional CSS to be supplied to force the alignment
of the nested lists, but already viewing the above example in ngPDF, you can see that the correct logical
list structure is correctly preserved in the derived HTML.

## Extended math support

To improve the accessibility of math equations the code tries to embed
MathML representations of all equations. As described below, these
MathML representations may be created automatically if you are using
LuaLaTeX, but may also be provided by the author.

Technically there are two methods of associating MathML with each
formula:

 * As an _associated file_ This is an embedded stream of XML within
   the PDF that exactly matches the MathML that you would use in other
   contexts such as a web page.
 * Using MathML Namespace _Structure Element_ tagging. This is a
   feature of PDF 2.0 that extends the PDF tags, as used for sections
   and lists and other document structure, by a set of tags
   corresponding to the elements defined by MathML.

LuaLaTeX (via the `luamml` package which is loaded automatically when
needed) includes a basic TeX to MathML converter so can generate both
these forms. If using other engines then only the Associated File
mechanism may be used.



### Associated MathML Files
By default, when using LuaLaTeX and `unicode-math` the mathematics will be
tagged with an Associated File of the generated MathML.

```
\DocumentMetadata{uncompress,lang=en,
 testphase={phase-III,math,table,title},
 pdfversion=2.0,pdfstandard=ua-2,pdfstandard=a-4f}

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{unicode-math}

\title{Math tagged with Associated Files (luamml)}
\author{LaTeX Team}
\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Basic mathematical expressions}

If $x$ is real, then $x^{2} \geq 0$.

A matrix equation.
\[
\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}c&d\\a&b\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end{document}
```

### MathML Structure Element Tagging

To use MathML Structure Element tagging you may use the
`math/mathml/structelem` key as shown below. Here we also suppress
adding the Associated Files.

```
\DocumentMetadata{uncompress,lang=en,
 testphase={phase-III,math,table,title},
 pdfversion=2.0,pdfstandard=ua-2,pdfstandard=a-4f}

\tagpdfsetup{
 math/mathml/structelem,
 math/tex/AF=false,
 math/mathml/AF=false
 }

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{unicode-math}

\title{Math tagged with MathML Structure Elements}
\author{LaTeX Team}
\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Basic mathematical expressions}

If $x$ is real, then $x^{2} \geq 0$.

A matrix equation.
\[
\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}c&d\\a&b\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end{document}
```

### Supplying MathML to be used for Associated File tagging,

For engines other than LuaTeX, or if you want to modify the automatically
generated MathML,then LaTeX needs to be supplied MathML in a separate file.

The format of the file may be seen in the example below.  which has a
prepared section for every equation found in the document. The section
shows the LaTeX-source and a hash value and a `<math></math>` tag.
LaTeX can write out a "dummy" version of this file with an empty math
element for each formula which must be filled in before LaTeX is
re-run to incorporate the MathML. This is controlled by use of the key
`math/mathml/write-dummy`.

The math should be filled with a suitable MathML representation and
the dummy file should then be renamed to `<file>-mathml.html`.

Even if using pdfLaTeX for the final document, you may prefer to use
LuaLaTeX for an intitial run as LuaLaTeX will write out a version of
the file with MathML already generated. If needed this MathML may
still be edited and the file renamed to `<file>-mathml.html` .


### Associated MathML Files (pdflatex)

```
% !TeX pdflatex
\DocumentMetadata{uncompress,lang=en,
 testphase={phase-III,math,table,title},
 pdfversion=2.0,pdfstandard=ua-2,pdfstandard=a-4f}

%\tagpdfsetup{math/mathml/write-dummy}

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\title{Math tagged with Associated Files (PdfTeX)}
\author{LaTeX Team}
\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Basic mathematical expressions}

If $x$ is real, then $x^{2} \geq 0$.

A matrix equation.
\[
\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}c&d\\a&b\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end{document}
```

Here we supply an additional file with MathML versions of each formula.  
[pdflatexexample-mathml.html](pdflatexexample-mathml.html)  
_View Source_ to see the MathML markup used.

**Note:** If the math in the above example is edited, the checksum will not match
and so the MathML for that formula will not be inserted. The MathML would need to be regenerated
however we do not provide an interface for that in this online example.

In the quaint village of Greenwood, nestled at the edge of a whispering forest,
a unique tradition has been thriving for centuries. Every spring, the villagers
gather to celebrate the Festival of Blooms, a vibrant event marked by an
explosion of colors and scents. The festival centers around the competition of
floral arrangements, where participants from all age groups display their
creativity with flowers handpicked from the surrounding woods. The air is filled
with the sweet fragrance of wild roses, lilacs, and jasmine, mingling with the
sound of laughter and folk music. Children dart between stalls, their faces
painted with petal motifs, while elders share stories of festivals past. The
highlight of the event is the crowning of the Bloom Queen, a title bestowed upon
the creator of the most breathtaking floral display. This tradition, more than
just a celebration, is a testament to the village's deep connection with nature
and its cycles

in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she
at once took up the little golden key and hurried off
to the garden door.\par
Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down
on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye;
but to get through was more hopeless than ever:
she sat down and began to cry again.}

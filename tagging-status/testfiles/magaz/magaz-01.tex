\begin{document}

\FirstLine{The first line of this paragraph is
           typeset in boldface. And more text to display the behavior.}
The remainder is set in the normal body font.

\FirstLine{\noindent Less material} in the argument
will be fully typeset in the special font. Note the
placement and result of the \verb=\noindent= command.

% produces parent-child warnings, but is a mistake as mentioned in the text
%\noindent\FirstLine{If placed in front it will get
%lost} as you can see here.

\FirstLine{There is no just \emph{ground}, therefore, $a+b=c$ for the charge $x\in\{0,1,2\}$ brought against me by certain ignoramuses.}

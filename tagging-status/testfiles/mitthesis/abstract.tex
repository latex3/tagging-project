The developments of the ``kinetic theory'' of gases made within the last ten years have enabled it to account satisfactorily for many of the laws of gases. The mathematical deductions of Clausius, Maxwell and others, based upon the hypothesis of a gas composed of molecules acting upon each other at impact like perfectly elastic spheres, have furnished expressions for the laws of its elasticity, viscosity, conductivity for heat, diffusive power and other properties. For some of these laws we have experimental data of value in testing the validity of these deductions and assumptions. Next to the elasticity, perhaps the phenomena of the viscosity of gases are best adapted to investigation.\footnote{Text from Holman (1876): \doi{10.2307/25138434}.}

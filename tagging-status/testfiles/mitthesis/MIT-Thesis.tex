% This TEST FILE should be run with mitthesis.cls version 1.19 (current CTAN release) or a later version.
%
% The result validates as PDF 2.0/UA-2 (or A-4F) under verapdf (https://demo.verapdf.org/) and the Arlington model (Arlington PDF 2.0 profile, ver.1.27.96)
% 		when run with lualatex: LuaHBTeX, Version 1.18.0 (TeX Live 2024), LaTeX2e <2024-11-01> patch level 1, L3 programming layer <2024-12-25>
%
% The longtable package is loaded, so not testing with pdftex.
%
% The current class file includes patches to address two tagging issues:
%		* interaction of caption package with lof/lot:     https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project/issues/720#issuecomment-2388327048
%		* tagging bug with large delimiters in some fonts: https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project/issues/757#issuecomment-2465417867
%
% The test files omit the listings package (appendixa), which is incompatible, and the mhchem package, which may not tag correctly.
% The layout table for signatures on the title page is not tagged as a presentation table at this point.
%
% Most of the available font options are not tested.

\documentclass[fontset=lmodern]{mitthesis}% fontset=newtx, fontset=libertine, fontset=libertinus, fontset=lmodern, 
%						fontset=newtx-sans-text, fontset=fira-newtxsf, fontset=heros-stix2, fontset=stix2, 
%						fontset=lmodern,fontset=lucida
%
% option [twoside]		gives facing-page behavior for printing; omitting twoside will eliminate even-numbered blank pages.
% option [lineno]	 	provides line numbers, as for editing
% option [mydesign] 	loads packages for color, title and list formats, margins, or captions: edit mydesign.tex to change defaults.
% option [fontset] is a keyvalue which can be:
%					 	for pdftex or unicode engines:  defaultfonts, libertine, libertinus, lmodern, lucida
%					 	for pdftex only: 				fira-newtxsf, newtx, newtx-sans-text
%						for unicode engines (luatex):	heros-stix2, stix2, termes, termes-stix2
%					 	if no key value is given, fonts default to CMR (pdftex) or LMR (unicode), i.e., "the LaTeX font".
%					 	You can edit the fontset files or you can write your own, myfonts.tex, and do [fontset=myfonts].
%						If you are using multiple languages, load the babel package in your fontset file, before the fonts.

%%%%%%%%% Packages used in sample chapters (not otherwise required) %%%%%%%

%% Package for code listing in Appendix A.
% \usepackage{listings}%   documentation is here https://ctan.org/pkg/listings

%% Set chemical formulas nicely
% \usepackage[version=4]{mhchem}%   documentation at https://ctan.org/pkg/mhchem

%% Latin filler used in Chapter 1, with a test for package version date (https://ctan.org/pkg/lipsum)
\usepackage{lipsum}
\IfPackageAtLeastTF{lipsum}{2021/09/20}{\setlipsum{auto-lang=false}}{}

%% Table related packages  

\usepackage{booktabs}% publication quality tables (https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs)

\usepackage{array}% Additional options for column formats (https://ctan.org/pkg/array)

\usepackage{dcolumn}% For alignment of numbers on the decimal place (https://ctan.org/pkg/dcolumn) 
  \newcolumntype{d}[1]{D{.}{.}{#1}}% use with dcolumn package. Note: dcolumns are set in math mode.
  % syntax: d{x.y} where x is max number of digits before decimal and y is max number after.

% Package for multipage table in Appendix B.
\usepackage{longtable}% typeset multi-page tables (https://ctan.org/pkg/longtable)

%\usepackage{tabularx}% adjustable-width columns in tabular (https://ctan.org/pkg/tabularx)


%% Package for improved typography

\usepackage{microtype}% typographic fine-tuning, used in sample thesis (https://ctan.org/pkg/microtype)


%%%%%%%%%  Graphics path (to figure files)  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Can set graphicspath to point to specific directories containing figures (the current directory is searched automatically)
%% For instance, to search a subdirectory of the current directory called "figures" and a parallel directory called "art", set:

% \graphicspath{ {figures/} {../art/} }% For details see: https://latexref.xyz/dev/latex2e.html#g_t_005cgraphicspath


%%%%%%%%%  Representative set-up for biblatex  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Numerical citations of references
\usepackage[style=ext-numeric-comp,giveninits=true,maxbibnames=10,sorting=none]{biblatex}
    \AtEveryBibitem{%
      \ifentrytype{article}{%
        \renewbibmacro{in:}{} % Removes "In:" for articles
      }{}
    }
    
%% IEEE style citations and references
% \usepackage[style=ieee,maxbibnames=10,sorting=none]{biblatex}% style=ext-numeric-comp,articlein=false,giveninits=true
%	 \DefineBibliographyStrings{english}{url= \textsc{url} ,  }% replaces the IEEE default "[Online]. Available" by "URL"

%% author-year style citations and references 
%% use \parencite, not \cite, when you want "(Author, year)"
%% The sample files are not set up to include parentheses.
% \usepackage[style=authoryear, maxbibnames=10]{biblatex} 


\addbibresource{mitthesis-sample.bib}%% <== change to YOUR bib file <= CHANGE

%% to avoid split urls and stretched white space, you can set the bibliography ragged-right:
%\appto{\bibsetup}{\raggedright}

%% biblatex is very powerful, and you can customize most aspects the reference list and citations to suit your needs.
%%   documentation is here: https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex
%%   cheat sheet is here:   https://tug.ctan.org/info/biblatex-cheatsheet/biblatex-cheatsheet.pdf

%% To ensure citations are set, run Latex --> biblatex/biber --> Latex again

%%%%%%%%%%  Option to use natbib   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\RequirePackage[numbers,sort&compress]{natbib}
 
%%% add bibliography to table of contents
%\apptocmd{\bibliography}{\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\protect\textbf{\bibname}}}{}{}

%%% You can use this to rename the bibliography section
%\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}

%%% To adjust space between bibliography items 
%\setlength\bibsep{4pt plus 1pt minus 1pt}
%   change 4pt to something else; don't drop last two lengths (they are stretchable "glue")


%%%%%%%%%%  Option for "double spacing" %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Back in the typewriter era, double spaced lines were convenient for editing with a pencil. 
%% In typography, the separation between lines is called "leading", and it is usually set in 
%% proportion to the font size (i.e., when the font is loaded).  If you really feel the need 
%% to change the line separation, the most attractive results will be obtained by changing the
%% leading in proportion to the the current font size, rather than just doubling the space.

%% The setspace package provides a tool for changing line separation. Use these two commands here:
%
% \usepackage{setspace}%  documentation at https://ctan.org/pkg/setspace
% \setstretch{1.1}% you can choose some other value for the stretch of space between lines
%
%% Use one or more of the these commands *AFTER* the frontmatter
%
% \onehalfspacing
% \doublespacing
% \singlespacing  % will turn these effects off (you can use these anywhere in the document)

%% The best result is usually to stay with leading selected by the typographer who set up the font.


%%%%%%%%%%%  Metadata  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Most of the document metadata is created automatically. 
% The following items should be adjusted to match your work. <================= !!!!!!!!!!

\hypersetup{%
	pdfsubject={Template for writing MIT theses with the mitthesis class},
	% Change this to briefly state topic of your thesis 
% 
	pdfkeywords={Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT},
	% Add keywords that will help search engines and libraries to find your work.
	% Includes the name[s] of the author[s] 
	% (If you used \DocumentMetadata at line 14, you can just put "\CopyrightAuthor," for the names.)
%
	pdfurl={},
	% If you have a url for the thesis, put it here. Otherwise delete this.
	% (MIT Libraries will put your thesis in DSPACE with a persistent url after you submit it.)
%	
	pdfcontactemail={},
	% You can put a [permanent] email address into the metadata, if you like.
	% Otherwise delete this.
%
	pdfauthortitle={},
	% If you have a title, you can include it here.
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%  Math operators %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% These commands declare two math operators, \erf{..} and \erfc{..} using mathtools
% note: * form produces automatic delimiter scaling; optional argument sets size manually, e.g. [\bigg]
% See Table 1.1 in Chapter 1

\DeclareMathOperator{\Erf}{erf}
\DeclareMathOperator{\Erfc}{erfc}
\DeclarePairedDelimiterXPP\erf[1]{\Erf\mkern1mu}(){}{#1}% increase to 2mu with stix2 font
\DeclarePairedDelimiterXPP\erfc[1]{\Erfc\mkern1mu}(){}{#1}

% \Author{Author full name}{Author department}[Author's first PREVIOUS degree][Author's second PREVIOUS degree][...
% Note that third, fourth, fifth, and sixth arguments are optional [] and may be omitted

% note on names: most of the following names are made up; Silas Holman was a physics professor at MIT in the 19th century.

% \Author{Luisa Hernández}{Department of Research}[B.S. Mechanical Engineering, UCLA, 2018][M.S. Stellar Interiors, Vulcan Science Academy, 2020]
% \Author{Thurston Howell III}{Department of Economics}[MBA, Ferengi School of Management, 2022]

% Use once for each degree fulfilled by thesis
% For two degrees from one department, leave the department argument blank for the second degree {}.
\Degree{Bachelor of Science in Physics}{Department of Physics}
%\Degree{Master of Science in Physics}{}
%\Degree{Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering}{Department of Mechanical Engineering}

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \Supervisor command for each.

% \Supervisor{Edward C. Pickering}{Professor of Physics, and \\ \> Professor of Something Else}
% \Supervisor{Secunda Castor}{Professor of Research}
% \Supervisor{Quintus Castor}{Professor of Log Dams}

% Professor who formally accepts theses for your department (e.g., the Graduate Officer, Professor Sméagol,...)
% If more than one department, use more than once
\Acceptor{Tertius Castor}{Professor of Log Dams}{Graduate Officer, Department of Research} % \\ \> Third title}
% \Acceptor{Quarta Castor}{Professor of Lodge Building}{Graduate Officer, Department of Mechanical Engineering}
%%%  If you need to reduce vertical space, put the acceptor title in the second argument and leave the third blank, {}.
% \Acceptor{Primus Castor}{Professor and Undergraduate Officer, Department of Physics}{}

% Usage: \DegreeDate{Month}{year}

%%%%%%%  Solutions for overflowing titlepage  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% If your title page is overflowing (from too many names, degrees, etc.):
%
% (a) you can reduce the 12pt and 18pt skips between various blocks to 6pt with this command:
%
% \Tighten
%
% (b)  you can scale down the Signature block at the bottom with this command:
%
% \SignatureBlockSize{\small}  %or this one \SignatureBlockSize{\footnotesize}
%
% (c) you can put the acceptor name and title onto two lines, rather than three like this:
%
% \Acceptor{Tertius Castor}{Professor and Graduate Officer, Department of Research}{}
%
% (d) you can change the font size of the author name[s] with
%
%	\AuthorNameSize{\normalsize}
%
% (e) and you can omit any previous degrees from the title page, instead mentioning them in the biographical sketch

% Also, if you prefer to keep the text toward the top of the page with most white space at the bottom, you
% can use this command to squash all of the vertical glue (stretchy space) with this command:
%
% \Squash 
%
% This command is useful when the text has not already reach the bottom of the page, since the glue gets squashed automatically
% when the page is too full.

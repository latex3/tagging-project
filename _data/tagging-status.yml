   comments: Loads tagpdf but it is not compatible with the current version. Its patches 
             clash with the math module. `phase-III,math` should be used instead which
             provides broader tagging support without the need to load an additional package.

   comments: The package itself can't be loaded right now. However, the tagging code supports (most of) the document-level  syntax of `enumitem`, so that one can use, for example, `\begin{itemize}[...]` out of the box.
   tasks: Check which keys are not yet supported and what else is missing.

     Rather than
     `\includegraphics[whatever]{whatever}`
     one should now write
     `\includegraphics[whatever, alt={This is the alternative text.}]{whatever}`
     The alternative text will be ignored if tagging is not used. It seems that draft mode doesn’t work at present.
     An old issue with height appears to be fixed.

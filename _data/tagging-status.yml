# --------------------------------------
#
# Status                 Meaning
# -----                  -------
# compatible             This package or class works without any issues when tagging is enabled
# partially-compatible   The package or class is currently partially compatible, see comments column
# currently-incompatible The package or class is currently incompatible with the tagging code, but we expect it to be updated eventually.
# no-support             This package or class or class is incompatible with the tagging code and we do *not* believe that it will ever be supported.
# unchecked                The status of this package or class is not known
#
# --------------------------------------
#
# Priority                 Meaning
#
# The priority values are some initial assessments on the order in which we might try to resolve incompatibilities
# with the tagging project based on a number of considerations. They do not necessarily reflect what is going to
# happen in the future. Two values are special:
#
# priority 9		Assigned to newly added packages that are not in either TLC3 nor in arXiv ranges
# priority 8		Assigned to packages mentioned in TLC3 but without any specific recommendation, e.g, either just mentioned in passing, or explicitly mentioned as problematic for one or the other reason.

  comments: Loads tagpdf but it is not compatible with the current version. Its patches
            clash with the math module. `phase-III,math` should be used instead which
            provides broader tagging support without the need to load an additional package.

  comments: "The package itself can't be loaded right now. However, the tagging code
             supports (most of) the document-level  syntax of `enumitem`, so that one
             can use, for example, `\\begin{itemize}[...]` out of the box."
  tasks: Check which keys are not yet supported and what else is missing.

    Rather than
    `\includegraphics[whatever]{whatever}`
    one should now write
    `\includegraphics[whatever, alt={This is the alternative text.}]{whatever}`
    The alternative text will be ignored if tagging is not used. It seems that draft mode doesn’t work at present.
    An old issue with height appears to be fixed.

             It is not compatible with current LaTeX, let alone with the tagging

             that brings it up to speed."
